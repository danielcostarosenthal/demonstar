About Shareware
=======================
This game is shareware, meaning you can freely use the product. 
If you like it or find it useful, then you must register with 
Mountain King Studios. This term "register" means you must purchase 
it directly from the developer. If you do not register this game 
within 30 days, you must delete it from your system. It is not likely
anyone will check to see if you use DemonStar  outside the terms of
shareware. However, shareware is available to many users today
because of user honesty. Mountain King Studios not only relies on 
this honesty, it greatly appreciates it. When you register, you will 
receive the FULL version of DemonStarSM2, which includes more
levels, music and fun then the shareware version.
