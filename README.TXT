because of user honesty. Mountain King Studios not only relies on 
this honesty, it greatly appreciates it. When you register, you will

How to Play	- see help in game for more
=======================

Key to the game is to work your way through the levels, while 
destroying the Boss at the end of each. Pick up bonuses along 
the way to increase your firepower to help you advance through 
the levels, while scoring as many points as possible. After upgrading
your shot, pick up the same color to increase the power and ray of
beam of that particular shot. If you accidentally pick up another color
after multiple upgrades, it will downgrade your shot to the weakest 
shot of that color. Your destiny is to destroy the Demonstar, at all 
costs!
